# Building the Infrastructure for Trusted Circular Materials

The world is moving toward circular supply chains — but the infrastructure to prove what's truly circular is still broken.

## The Current State

Today, recyclers, recovery operators, and remanufacturers do critical work recovering materials and keeping resources in use. Yet they're forced to rely on fragmented spreadsheets, manual audits, and inconsistent standards to prove the value of what they produce.

We exist to change that.

## 🏗️ Our Mission

We help circular materials companies prove, protect, and increase the value of their materials through trusted, verifiable circular data.

**Goal:** Make circular proof as reliable, tradable, and valuable as the materials themselves.

- **Track** - Material flows from input to output with precision.
- **Generate** - Verifiable circular proof and chain-of-custody records.
- **Share** - Trusted data directly with buyers, partners, and regulators.
- **Unlock** - Premium pricing and faster procurement approval cycles.

## Who We Build For

We focus on the companies doing the hard, real-world work of circularity.

**01 Materials Recyclers** - Industrial scale processors of waste streams.

**02 Recovery Operators** - Specialized reprocessing and refinement facilities.

**03 Industrial Remanufacturers** - Extending lifecycle for high-value components.

**04 Material Recovery Innovators** - Advanced tech startups solving complex waste.

These are the organisations turning waste streams into supply chains — and they deserve infrastructure built specifically for them.

## Why This Matters

Global supply chains are under pressure to prove sustainability, reduce risk, and comply with new regulations. At the same time, circular material producers are being asked to prove more — with fewer tools and less standardisation.

- A market access requirement
- A pricing advantage
- A competitive differentiator

## Our Belief

We believe the future of industry is transparent, verifiable, collaborative, and circular by default. And we believe the companies already doing the work should capture more of the value.

## Where We're Going

An open, interoperable infrastructure layer that helps circular supply chains scale globally — without gatekeepers.
